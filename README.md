# How to use

Clone the repository and enter in its directory. Run `build.sh` script. This will download `languages.yml` file and will convert it to a JSON one:

```sh
$ ./build.sh
```

The JSON file will be saved in `github-colors.json` file.

Also, you can find the JSON files in [dist](./dist) directory.
